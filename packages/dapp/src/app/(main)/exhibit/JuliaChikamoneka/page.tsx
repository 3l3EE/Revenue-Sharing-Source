      <h3 >Julia Chikamoneka</h3>
      <p>The fierce activist and pioneer of freedom from colonial rule</p>
      <p>(1910 - 1986)</p>
      <p>
      Julia Mulenga ‘Chikamoneka’ was born Mary Nsofwa Lombe between 1904 and 1910 in Kasama Northern Zambi. She was the daughter of Mulenga Lombe son of Chief Chitimukulu-Ponde, who served as an African sergeant during the First world war.

      The exposure to the welfare associations introduced Julia to politics and she quit her job and opened a food stall near Kabwata where she mobilized fellow women marketeers into organized protests groups for the NRAC which later became known as the African National Congress (ANC).

      She used her position in the market where she interacted with many women of all walks of life to effectively recruit them to join ANC and encourage them to attend rallies. She went around at night ringing a stone-filled tin as a call to upcoming political events rallies.

      She also took up a leading role in planning protest marches and organizing boycotts of shops that discriminated based on race. Julia Chikamoneka’s led protests had such profound effects and ultimately led to the independence of Zambia in 1964.

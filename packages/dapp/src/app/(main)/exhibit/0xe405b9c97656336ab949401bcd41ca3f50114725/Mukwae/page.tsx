      <h3 >Mukwae</h3>
      <p>The secretary of state for the Nalolo western province</p>
      <p>(1910 - 1986)</p>
      <p>
      The Mukwae Nalolo governed a province of the Barotse Kingdom of Nalolo. She also maintained a dignity second only to the Litunga, who was the King.
      </p>
      <p>
      After the scramble for Africa of 1884 to 1888, the Italians were given charge of delineating boundaries into new nations and many previous tribal boundaries were affected.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Mukwae wrote to the Italian Government and demanded that her land be clearly delineated from that of the Portuguese and stop them from infringing on her peopleâ€™s rights.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Italians were forced to demarcate the boundary of her province along the 38th parallel of Longitude, which is the boundary line of Zambia that still stands today.

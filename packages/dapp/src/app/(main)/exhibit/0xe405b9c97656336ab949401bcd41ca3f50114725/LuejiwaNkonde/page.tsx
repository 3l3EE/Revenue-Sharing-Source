        <h3>Lueji wa Nkonde</h3>
        <p>The 17th Century Political Negotiator</p>
        <p>(1910 - 1986)</p>
        <p>
          Lueji was the daughter of Mwata Iyala Mwaku, a descendant of Queen
          Kenga Naweji. Mwata Iyala Mwaku appointed Lueji wa Konde as his
          successor, or Nswana Mu Luunda.
        </p>
        <p>
          He then gave her the Lukano bracelet, a sign of authority over all the
          Luunda tu buungo. She ruled the Lunda federation of Tubungo in the
          1650s.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lueji’s reign resulted in the migration of various groups who became
          the Lunda, Luchazi, Luwena, Luvale and Chokwe, the Ndembu, Mbwela,
          Samba, Munungu, and the Mbunda people in today’s North-Western
          Province of Zambia.
        </p>
        <p>
          The migration also spread to adjacent areas in The Democratic Republic
          of Congo, Namibia, and Angola. Which has now become most of the
          population of Northwestern Province.

      <p>The Warrior Queen of the Sala people

</p>
      <p>(1910 - 1986)</p>
      <p>
      She ruled the Sala people of the Mumbwa area. She was the current ruler of the Sala people when the Makololo invaded her land.
      </p>
      <p>
      Loongo organized an all-women army and fought the Makololo, leaving a mark on the Makololo ranks through their sheer courage and determination.
      </p>
      <p>
      Although she was not successful in repelling the Makololo and was captured and held prisoner for a time by the Makololo, upon her release, she re-organized her people and brought back peace and dignity to her Kingdom.
      </p>
      <p>
      Due to her unusual courage and powers, the Makololo respected her and even though the Sala were conquered, they were never made to pay tribute by the Makololo like other conquered peoples.

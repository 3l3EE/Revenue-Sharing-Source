# Navbar Component Documentation

The `Navbar` component is designed to offer a responsive and customizable navigation solution for React applications. It features an adaptive layout suitable for a wide range of devices, integrates search functionality for desktop views, and utilizes icons for a modern interface. This component is built to work seamlessly with Next.js for routing and is styled using Tailwind CSS for a sleek appearance.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: Automatically adjusts to the screen size, providing a mobile-friendly collapsible menu for smaller devices.
- **Search Integration**: Incorporates a search input field in desktop views to enhance site navigation.
- **Heroicons**: Uses `@heroicons/react` for high-quality SVG icons, enhancing the visual appeal and user experience.
- **Next.js Compatibility**: Leverages `next/link` for optimized single-page application (SPA) navigation.
- **Customizable Button**: Includes a `ButtonOrange` component, offering a prominent call-to-action for users.

## Installation

Before integrating the `Navbar` component into your project, ensure you have React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS configured. If not already included in your project, you can add `@heroicons/react` for icons:

```bash
npm install @heroicons/react
# or
yarn add @heroicons/react

```

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Navbar from "./components/Navbar"; // Adjust the import path based on your directory structure

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <>
      <Navbar />
      {/* Main application content goes here */}
    </>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```
